### Lidar 3D Object Detetction Project

This is a summary of the implementation of the results of Lidar 3D object detection project

### Summary for Project Step One. it is divided into two section. Below is the result for each section

## Visualize range image channels (ID_S1_EX1)

I followed the instructions below:

In file loop_over_dataset.py, set the attributes for code execution in the following way:

- 1- data_filename = 'training_segment-1005081002024129653_5313_150_5333_150_with_camera_labels.tfrecord
- 2- show_only_frames = [0, 1]
- 3- exec_detection = []
- 4- exec_visualization = ['show_range_image']



I implemented the show_range_image function located in the file student/objdet_pcl.py.

Inside the function I followed the requiured steps:

Convert range image “range” channel to 8bit


The outcome is a visualization of the range image

### Waymo Open Dataset Files
This project makes use of three different sequences to illustrate the concepts of object detection and tracking. These are: 
- Sequence 1 : `training_segment-1005081002024129653_5313_150_5333_150_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 2 : `training_segment-10072231702153043603_5725_000_5745_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 3 : `training_segment-10963653239323173269_1924_000_1944_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`

To download these files, you will have to register with Waymo Open Dataset first: [Open Dataset – Waymo](https://waymo.com/open/terms), if you have not already, making sure to note "Udacity" as your institution.

Once you have done so, please [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files) to access the Google Cloud Container that holds all the sequences. Once you have been cleared for access by Waymo (which might take up to 48 hours), you can download the individual sequences. 

The sequences listed above can be found in the folder "training". Please download them and put the `tfrecord`-files into the `dataset` folder of this project.


### Pre-Trained Models
The object detection methods used in this project use pre-trained models which have been provided by the original authors. They can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pqx7sShlqKSGmvshTYbNDcUEYyZwfn3A/view?usp=sharing) (darknet) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RcEfUIF1pzDZco8PJkZ10OL-wLL2usEj/view?usp=sharing) (fpn_resnet). Once downloaded, please copy the model files into the paths `/tools/objdet_models/darknet/pretrained` and `/tools/objdet_models/fpn_resnet/pretrained` respectively.

### Using Pre-Computed Results

In the main file `loop_over_dataset.py`, you can choose which steps of the algorithm should be executed. If you want to call a specific function, you simply need to add the corresponding string literal to one of the following lists: 

- `exec_data` : controls the execution of steps related to sensor data. 
  - `pcl_from_rangeimage` transforms the Waymo Open Data range image into a 3D point-cloud
  - `load_image` returns the image of the front camera

- `exec_detection` : controls which steps of model-based 3D object detection are performed
  - `bev_from_pcl` transforms the point-cloud into a fixed-size birds-eye view perspective
  - `detect_objects` executes the actual detection and returns a set of objects (only vehicles) 
  - `validate_object_labels` decides which ground-truth labels should be considered (e.g. based on difficulty or visibility)
  - `measure_detection_performance` contains methods to evaluate detection performance for a single frame

In case you do not include a specific step into the list, pre-computed binary files will be loaded instead. This enables you to run the algorithm and look at the results even without having implemented anything yet. The pre-computed results for the mid-term project need to be loaded using [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-s46dKSrtx8rrNwnObGbly2nO3i4D7r7?usp=sharing) link. Please use the folder `darknet` first. Unzip the file within and put its content into the folder `results`.

- `exec_tracking` : controls the execution of the object tracking algorithm

- `exec_visualization` : controls the visualization of results
  - `show_range_image` displays two LiDAR range image channels (range and intensity)
  - `show_labels_in_image` projects ground-truth boxes into the front camera image
  - `show_objects_and_labels_in_bev` projects detected objects and label boxes into the birds-eye view
  - `show_objects_in_bev_labels_in_camera` displays a stacked view with labels inside the camera image on top and the birds-eye view with detected objects on the bottom
  - `show_tracks` displays the tracking results
  - `show_detection_performance` displays the performance evaluation based on all detected 
  - `make_tracking_movie` renders an output movie of the object tracking results

Even without solving any of the tasks, the project code can be executed. 

The final project uses pre-computed lidar detections in order for all students to have the same input data. If you use the workspace, the data is prepared there already. Otherwise, [download the pre-computed lidar detections](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IkqFGYTF6Fh_d8J3UjQOSNJ2V42UDZpO?usp=sharing) (~1 GB), unzip them and put them in the folder `results`.
